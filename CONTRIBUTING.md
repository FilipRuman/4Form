## Contribution guide:
I'm searching for new contributors for this project and there are a lot of easy, good for newcomers tasks. 
So if you are interested in contributing either by writing c#, making ui, writing rust, fixing readme etc. please read steps below before contributing.
thanks in advance.

### how to find good task
 1. [open this project](https://github.com/users/FilipRuman/projects/6/views/3)
 2. look at label for priority of this issue. [**good first issue**](https://github.com/FilipRuman/4Form/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22) label might be a good indicator for new contributors.
 3. select task that looks the most interesting. read summary and all comments.
 4. write a comment that you are working on this issue.
 5. create new branch with appropriate name.
 6. implement changes.
 7. push all changes to **YOUR** remote branch
 8. create pull request from **your** to **dev** branch
 9. give the pull request a good name and describe changes, for changes in ui a screenshot of changes would be nice.  
### Before code contribution
